# Hero Section Animation Project

## Overview
This project recreates an interactive **hero section** inspired by the Pha5e website. It includes smooth animations, hover effects, and a mouse movement effect for an engaging user experience.

## Features
- **Smooth Initial Animation**: Text and images appear with fade-in and scale-up effects.
- **Hover Interaction**: The hovered image becomes fully visible while others transform into a vector-like style.
- **Mouse Movement Effect**: Hovered images subtly follow the cursor.
- **Responsive Design**: Works seamlessly on different screen sizes.
- **Bootstrap Integration**: For layout and styling consistency.

## Technologies Used
- **HTML**
- **CSS** (Animations & Effects)
- **JavaScript** (Interactive Effects)
- **Bootstrap** (Layout & Responsiveness)
